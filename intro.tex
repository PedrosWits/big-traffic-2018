\section{Introduction}

% Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras are used thou component of current intelligent transportation systems. 

Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras actively employed in cities and urban traffic environments as part of recent advancements in intelligent transportation systems. They can be used in traffic control by Urban Traffic Control and Management (UTMC) entities; in electronic toll collection by comissioned highway agencies; or by law enforcement agencies in the detection of speeding vehicles and validation of number plate registrations. The wide diversity of applications paired with improved performance of ANPR hardware and software systems, has caused an increase in the number of ANPR cameras installed across the UK~\cite{EvolutionUTMC2013}.

There are 267 ANPR cameras in the area of Tyne and Wear, United Kingdom, . Scans made by these cameras are stored in a central database by the UTMC of Tyne and Wear and then used to compute travel times across particular links of interest in the road network. These can be major roads that see high volumes of traffic, or road segments that can be more prone to traffic jams. Average journey times can be then conveyed back to the drivers by the way of Variable Message Signs (VMS) or through . Even though the cameras only cover a very small subset of the entire road network, it provides valuable.

However, Furthermore, ANPR cameras can either be fixed or

Number plate data is not as popular, for urban traffic monitoring and prediction , as other sources of data, namely GPS traces or floating vehicle data.

but, to the best of our knowledge, little research has gone into doing so with number plate data. Therefore, the contributions of this paper are twofold:

% \begin{equation} \label{e1.1}
% A x = b
% \end{equation}
% where $A$ is large, sparse, symmetric, and positive definite.  We consider
% the direct solution of (\ref{e1.1}) by means of general sparse Gaussian
% elimination.  In such a procedure, we find a permutation matrix $P$, and
% compute the decomposition

% P A P^{t} = L D L^{t}

% where $L$ is unit lower triangular and $D$ is diagonal.
